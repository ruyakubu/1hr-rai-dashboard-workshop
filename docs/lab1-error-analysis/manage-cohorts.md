# View the cohorts lists

The RAI dashboard gives you the ability to view, edit, delete or manage the cohorts you create.  

1. To view or manage all the cohorts you've created, click on the **"Settings"** gear icon on the upper right-hand corner of the Error Analysis section.

2. This will open a "Cohort Settings" window pane will the list of all the cohorts you created.  **Note**:  The RAI dashboard creates a cohort called "All data" by default. This cohort contains all the test dataset used to evaluate the model.
